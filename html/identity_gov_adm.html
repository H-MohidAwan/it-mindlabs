          Nowadays, organizations face the challenge of managing and controlling
          user access for both human or 'carbon' identities (like employees,
          contractors, partners, etc.) and non-human or 'silicon' identities
          (like services, bots, etc.) across various networks, data, and
          applications. This needs to be done while addressing significant
          business challenges such as reorganizations, mergers and acquisitions,
          cybersecurity threats, and regulatory compliance. Therefore, Identity
          Governance and Administration (IGA) solutions are an essential
          component of any company's strategic Identity and Access Management
          (IAM) program. These solutions provide many critical capabilities,

          Our IGA services and solutions empower IT security managers, auditors,
          and business owners to govern access and assess regulatory compliance
          across the organization. We ensure that users have the appropriate
          access throughout their lifecycle, while providing better visibility
          and identifying the areas of highest risk. We take a practical,
          multi-phased approach to IGA that prioritizes your IT security and
          compliance demands, and integrates systems and processes with your
          existing infrastructure. Our focused scope delivers business benefits
          and improvements quickly, helping you maintain executive support from
          day one.

        <h1>Identity Lifecycle Management</h1>
        <h4>Improve how you operate before you automate</h4>
        <p>
          Securing, streamlining, then automating identity lifecycle processes,
          from onboarding to termination, is a critical way to safeguard your
          organization while boosting productivity. We can help you maximize
          your IGA solution’s efficacy and ease of use, including a
          multi-platform or hybrid solution (like SailPoint and Okta) that
          combines access management and IGA.

        <h1>Access Request & Approval Service</h1>
        <h4>The right access approved by the right people in less time</h4>
        <p>
          Few processes introduce more security/regulatory risk and are more
          time-consuming and frustrating than obtaining additional system access
          to fulfill special assignments and/or new job duties. A well-designed,
          SoD-aware, business-friendly access request and approval service
          capably addresses both problems to enable significantly greater
          workforce efficiency and productivity, while reducing security and
          regulatory violation risks.

        <h1>Access Governance</h1>
        <h4>Enable controls for who has regulated access to what, and when</h4>
        <p>
          A strong access governance model gives organizations a predictable,
          centralized way to enforce regulatory controls through role-based
          access provisioning and periodic access certifications, and to
          streamline regulatory audit evidence reporting. It’s key for adhering
          to government regulations like GDPR, SOX, FINRA, and HIPAA, and
          Integral Partners brings the depth of experience and professionalism
          required to ensure the best access governance solution is configured
          for and adopted by your organization.

        <h1>IGA + PAM Integration</h1>
        <h4>Include privileged access in your governance model</h4>
        <p>
          If you’re managing PAM independent of your access governance solution,
          you won’t have complete visibility of your organization’s high-risk
          access. This can cause dangerous access combinations or oversights
          that ultimately result in unnecessary security and compliance risks.
          For this reason, it makes sense to prioritize inclusion of privileged
          access in your governance model by integrating your PAM and IGA
          solutions. You can learn more about our CyberArk and SailPoint
          platform integration service here.

          The top IGA platforms each have their own unique set of strengths and
          weaknesses, which can be difficult to distinguish. However, we possess

          Whether you are just starting the process of selecting a vendor or
          already in the midst of it, we can help you evaluate your current
          requirements, budget, and artifacts and provide detailed
          recommendations based on your business objectives. This will ensure
          that you get high-quality responses from vendors. Additionally, we can
          provide comprehensive evaluations and recommendations based on your
          specific requirements and objectives.

          Even if you already have an Identity Governance and Administration
          (IGA) solution in place, implementing a comprehensive Role-Based
          Access Control (RBAC) solution can solve persistent access-related
          business challenges and take your IAM program to a higher level of
          professionalism. By defining and governing well-structured roles,
          including enterprise, business, technical, and bespoke roles, you can
          eliminate access certification fatigue, simplify individual ad hoc
          access requests, mitigate SoD violations, and streamline internal and
          external audit reporting. Integral Partners has the experience,
          expertise, and best practices to help you build an effective RBAC
          operation within your IAM program, including proper and practical role
          definition, role governance, and role lifecycle management.

          Manually intensive processes and outdated or deficient tools can cause
          great pain and cost to your business in the IGA space. In such cases,
          internal users are often frustrated with the experience of obtaining
          or changing access to the necessary systems to perform their job. This
          is usually due to the process being too cumbersome, inconsistent or
          time-consuming. Compliance failures are also more common when heavily
          manual processes are used for provisioning and certifying access.
        </p>
        <p class="sec-6-rght-p">
          A roadmap that prioritizes mitigating actual audit findings can differ
          from one that focuses on improving IAM efficiencies and enhancing user
          experience. We can assist you in prioritizing your IGA improvement
          roadmap to address the most pressing needs of your organization.

          Introducing AI and Machine Learning (AI/ML) to your Identity
          Governance and Administration (IGA) solution can result in significant
          benefits by providing intelligent automation and generating actionable
          insights. Access requests, approvals, access reviews, role modeling,
          and maintenance all become more efficient with the integration of a
          proper AI/ML solution. This integration leads to a reduction in the
          time and effort spent on governance of these processes. Moreover, it
          reduces the risk to your identity and access landscape, simplifies
          regulatory compliance, and improves it.

          SailPoint's IdentityNow SaaS platform offers exclusive new
          capabilities such as AI and Cloud Access Management. As a result,
          hybrid scenarios that combine IdentityNow with their on-premise
          platform Identity IQ are becoming increasingly common. By combining
          the two platforms, either on-premise or hosted in the cloud,
          organizations can take advantage of these new features. One example of
          a hybrid option is Password Management (end-user PW resets) through
          IDN paired with IIQ. This can allow end-users to reset their passwords
          through the cloud if they are locked out of accessing the network
          where IIQ resides.

        <p class="sec-6-rght-p">
          It is not common for companies to move from an existing IIQ to IDN

          and financially beneficial. By assessing the complexity of your
          current IGA needs and processes compared to the capabilities and
          viability of a SaaS solution, we can determine the level of effort and
          value of a possible Hybrid solution or SaaS migration.

          All organizations face the challenge of securely managing the
          lifecycle and regulating access for non-employee users. If not done
          properly, there is a high risk of severe financial and brand
          consequences. However, the level of sophistication required for a
          solution to address this risk depends on several variables, including
          the types of users (such as contractors, partners, suppliers, and
          vendors), the risk level associated with each type of access required,
          and the scale of the organization.
